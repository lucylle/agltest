# AGL Test

## About the solution
The solution is written in Angular 6 and whatever comes with it.

## Spinning up the service
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma].

## Why Angular
It could have been written in almost anything, but in my mind, .Net tends to play the role of generating data and the front-end consume it. Hence it just felt right using Angular.  

## Where are the integration tests
The program does one thing. If I was to include any integration tests, it would just be the default generated one and that felt a little like cheating.
